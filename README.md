# 1. Introduction
These proposal is to upgrade xCIPHS (xDai) token to a cryptoccurency coin, prebuilt on standalone blockchain which dominated by Ciphscoin (CIPHS) as a main cryptocurrency. The purpose is to upgrade the functionality of native xCIPHS token (xDai) to a Coin that represent as Decentralize Cryptocurrency that tradeable with value within Ciphscoin Protocol Network (CPN). Till date these project are self funded by crowdsale and devs, which makes CIPHS entirely 100% immunitable blockhain based fintech project.

# 2. CIP#3 Hardfork xCIPHS to CIPHS
As per whitepaper we plan to build other coin for DAO. We have tried a few options which use tremendous cost and time for R&D. Comed to the the final conclusion with decision to  build a standalone blockchain for Ciphscoin. Prior to the upgrade, we propose to upgrade xCIPHS (xDai) to Ciphscoin (CIPHS). Ciphscoin Protocol Network (CPN) will be backed by 100% Proof-of-Work consensus. These benefits everyone with fair start. Feel free to start mining CIPHS with CPU and support the network security.

Coin Name: Ciphscoin

Ticker: CIPHS

Decimal: 8

Distribution: 100% PoW (CPU/GPU Mining)

Max Supply: 27 million + tail emission

Premine: 6 Million from xCIPHS

# 2.1. Hardfork for xCIPHS holder
Ciphscoin function are different from erc20/xdai where everything included in one code. Such as security, functionality, compatibility, consensus and token standard and such requiring all together within 1 smart contract. With standalone Ciphs Private Network (CPN) backed by Ciphscoin, these task are distributed among many entities. We have Nodes, Miners, Users, Devs, Intitution, Enterprise and who knows who. All function within CIPHS (erc20/xdai) such as Minting and Meritocracy are now autonomous and based on proof. While the concept of Voting are handled by Miners with Proof-of-Work which the best in terms of 'automation'. Ciphs Private Network are surely the stronger place to build Transparency and Equality which is 100% Proof-of-Work base public ledger, coming with extra benefits such as private transfer. Did we mention Ciphscoin is 12 second per block tx? and there's more.
